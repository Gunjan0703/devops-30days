# Amazon Comprehend - Complete Overview

## Introduction
Amazon Comprehend is a fully managed natural language processing (NLP) service offered by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** that uses machine learning to extract insights and relationships from unstructured text. 
It's designed to be accessible to developers without deep machine learning expertise.
The service is versatile, supporting both real-time and batch analysis.

## Common Use Cases
Amazon Comprehend is a versatile tool with numerous applications:
- **Social Media Monitoring:** Monitoring social media feeds and online reviews to understand public opinion about a brand or product.
- **Semantic Search:** Enhance search engines by enabling them to identify key entities, phrases, and sentiments, allowing users to search based on context and intent rather than just keywords.
- **Customer Service:** Analyzing customer emails, support tickets, and call center transcripts to automatically route inquiries, detect common issues, and gauge customer satisfaction.
- **Classify Support Tickets:** Automatically categorize inbound support documents (e.g., tickets, forum posts) to streamline customer service operations.
- **Healthcare and Life Sciences:** Analyzing clinical notes, research papers, and patient records to extract medical insights.
- **Document Processing:** Organizing and extracting key information from large repositories of legal or business documents.

## How it Works?

```
        Text Input (documents, reviews, social media, S3 files, streams)
                                   ↓
        Preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning, language detection)
                                   ↓
        Feature Extraction (word embeddings, context vectors, syntax parsing)
                                   ↓
        NLP Models (sentiment classifier, entity recognizer, key phrase extractor, PII detector, syntax analyzer, topic modeler)
                                   ↓
        Enhancements (confidence scores, relationships, categories, custom entities/models)
                                   ↓
        Output (structured JSON: sentiments, entities, key phrases, syntax, topics, PII)
                                   ↓
        Integration (stored in S3 / analyzed with Redshift, QuickSight, or real-time stream to Lambda/Kinesis)
```
Amazon Comprehend uses continuously trained, pre-built models to provide insights. 
While you can use these models directly, you also have the option to build your own custom models for classification and entity recognition.

**Processing Modes**
- Synchronous Mode: For real-time processing of a single document or a small batch of up to 25 documents.
- Asynchronous Mode: For processing large numbers of documents stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, suitable for bulk analysis.

## Benefits

## Pricing
- Pay-as-you-go: You are charged based on the amount of text you process.
- Pricing Unit: Pricing is based on a unit of 100 characters for most APIs.
- Tiered Pricing: The price per unit decreases as your usage volume increases.
- Free Tier: A free tier is available for eligible APIs, covering a certain number of units or characters per month for a specified period.
- Asynchronous vs. Synchronous:
    - Asynchronous (Batch) Jobs: Billed by the total size of documents processed. Topic modeling, for example, has a flat rate for the first 100MB and a per-MB charge after that.
    - Synchronous (Real-time) Endpoints: For custom models, you are charged per second for each provisioned "inference unit" while the endpoint is active, regardless of whether it's being used.
- Custom Model Costs:
   - Model Training: Billed per hour of training time.
   - Endpoint Hosting: Billed per second for each active inference unit, with a minimum charge.
Model Management: A monthly charge for storing a custom model.

## Limitations
- Document Size:
   - Synchronous (Real-time) APIs: The maximum size for a single text document is limited (e.g., 5,000 bytes or 10KB depending on the API).
   - Asynchronous (Batch) Jobs: The maximum file size per document is larger (e.g., 1MB for certain operations), and the total size of all files in a single request has a a limit (e.g., 5 GB).
- Language Support: While a wide range of languages are supported, some dialects or less common languages may not be available for all features.
- Custom Models:
    - Training Data: There are minimum requirements for the number of documents and annotations per category to train a custom model effectively.
    - Accuracy: The performance of custom models is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the training data you provide.
- Dependency Parsing: Some features, such as Syntax Analysis, may lack advanced capabilities like full dependency parsing, which can limit their use for more complex linguistic analysis.
- Real-time Endpoint Cost: For custom models, you are charged for the endpoint's provisioned throughput for the entire duration it is active, which can become expensive if not carefully managed.
