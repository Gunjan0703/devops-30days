At its core, a large language model is built on a Transformer architecture, which processes and generates text by predicting the next token in a sequence. This step-by-step process enables the model to understand context and generate coherent, human-like responses.

**1. Input & Embedding Layer**
This is where raw text is converted into a numerical format that the model can understand.

Tokenization: The first step is to break down the input text into a sequence of smaller units called tokens. These can be words, subwords, or individual characters. This is a crucial step because the model works with numbers, not words.

Token Embedding: Each token is then mapped to a numerical vector, known as an embedding. This vector is a multi-dimensional representation of the token's meaning, capturing semantic relationships. For instance, words like "king" and "queen" will have similar embedding vectors.

Positional Encoding: Because the Transformer processes tokens in parallel, it needs a way to understand the order of words. Positional encodings are added to the token embeddings to provide this crucial sequential information. They are unique vectors that encode the position of each token in the input sequence.

**2. Transformer Decoder Blocks**
The heart of the LLM is a stack of these identical blocks, which are the main engine for processing and understanding the input. Each block contains several key components.

Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention: This is the most important part of the model. It's an attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of all other tokens in the sequence when processing a single token.  It's called "multi-head" because it performs this calculation several times in parallel, each time focusing on a different aspect of the relationships between words. The "masked" part is vital for text generation; it ensures that a token can only pay attention to the tokens that came before it, preventing the model from "cheating" by looking at the answer.

Add & Layer Normalization: This step is critical for training stability. Residual connections are used to create "shortcuts" that allow information to bypass certain layers, which helps prevent the model's performance from degrading as it gets deeper. Layer normalization is applied to ensure that the values within the neural network remain in a stable range, which is essential for training models with billions of parameters.

Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN): Following the attention mechanism, a standard neural network with multiple layers is applied to each token's representation independently. This network adds non-linearity and allows the model to learn more complex patterns and relationships.

**3. Output Layer**
After the final Transformer block, the output is prepared for a prediction.

Linear Projection & Softmax: The final vector from the last token is fed into a linear layer, which converts it into a set of logitsâ€”a numerical score for every word in the model's vocabulary. A softmax function then converts these logits into a probability distribution, where the probabilities of all words add up to 1. The word with the highest probability is the model's prediction for the next token.

**4. Training Objective**
LLMs are typically trained with a Causal Language Modeling objective. The model is given a sequence of text and its task is to predict the next token. It does this repeatedly on a massive dataset, learning the statistical patterns of language. This pre-training phase allows the model to develop its broad understanding, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks.
