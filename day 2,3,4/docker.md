# What is Docker Architecture?
Think of Docker like a shipping company. Just as a shipping company has different parts working together (trucks, warehouses, tracking systems), Docker has different components that work together to run your applications.
# Main Components of Docker
## 1. Docker Engine (The Heart)
This is the main program that runs on your computerIt's like the engine of a car - it makes everything workIt has three main parts:Docker Daemon: The background service that does the actual workREST API: How other programs talk to DockerDocker CLI: The command-line tool you use to give instructions
## 2. Docker Client (Your Interface)
This is what you use when you type docker commandsIt's like a remote control for your TV - you press buttons, and it tells the TV what to doWhen you type docker run, the client sends this request to the Docker daemon
## 3. Docker Registry (The Store)
This is where Docker images are storedDocker Hub is like an app store for Docker imagesYou can download (pull) images from here or upload (push) your own
# 3. Docker Lifecycle
## Image Lifecycle
- Build: Create an image from a Dockerfile
- Tag: Give the image a name and version
- Push: Upload to a registry (like Docker Hub)
- Pull: Download from a registry
- Remove: Delete the image when not needed
## Container Lifecycle
- Create: Make a container from an image
- Start: Begin running the container
- Stop: Pause the container
- Restart: Stop and start again
- Remove: Delete the container permanently
        
        
# What is a Docker Container?
A Docker container is like actually cooking the meal using the recipe:It's a running instance of an imageIt's the actual application working and doing its jobEach container is isolated from othersYou can have multiple containers from the same image.

## Installation

- sudo apt install docker.io - install docker on linux
- sudo systemctl enable docker - enable docker
- sudo systemctl status docker - checks the status of the docker whether it is running or not

docker run --name my-container nginx

- Run in background (detached mode)
docker run -d nginx

- Run with port mapping
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx

- Run interactively
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash

## listing container
- Show running containers
docker ps

- Show all containers (running and stopped)
docker ps -a

- Show only container IDs
docker ps -q

## Maintaining container state
- Stop a running container
docker stop container_name

- Start a stopped container
docker start container_name

- Restart a container
docker restart container_name

- Pause a container
docker pause container_name

- Unpause a container
docker unpause container_name

## Entering containers
- Execute a command in a running container
docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash

- Attach to a running container
docker attach container_name

## Container Information
- Show container details
docker inspect container_name

- Show container logs
docker logs container_name

- Show running processes in container
docker top container_name

- Show resource usage
docker stats container_name

## Removing containers
- Remove a stopped container
docker rm container_name

- Remove a running container (force)
docker rm -f container_name

- Remove all stopped containers
docker container prune
